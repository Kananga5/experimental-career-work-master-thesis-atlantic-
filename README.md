    NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I Eligibility Information:
    In addition to receiving an invitation to submit a full proposal from the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I
    Program based upon the review of their submitted Project Pitch,potential proposers to the program
    must also qualify as a small business concern to participate in the program (see SBIR/STTR
    Eligibility Guidefor more information).
    The firm must be in compliance with the SBIR/STTR Policy Directive(s) and the Code of Federal
    Regulations (13 CFR 121).
    • Your company must be a small business (fewer than 500 employees) located in the United
    States. Please note that the size limit of 500 employees includes affiliates.
    • At least 50% of your company’s equity must be owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents,
    and all funded work needs to take place in the United States (including work done by consultants
    and contractors).• Primary employment is defined as at least 51 percent employed by the small business. NSF
    normally considers a full-time work week to be 40 hours and considers employment elsewhere
    of greater than 19.6 hours per week to be in conflict with this requirement.
    • The Principal Investigator needs to commit to at least one month (173 hours) of effort to the
    funded project, per six months of project duration.
    For more detailed information, please refer to the SBIR/STTR Eligibility Guide by using
    https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf. Please note that these
    requirements need to be satisfied at the time an SBIR/STTR award is made, and not necessarily
    when the proposal is submitted.

    : Framework for Vocational Education with a Focus on NATED and NCV
    Integration in South African Colleges
    This topic can explore the integration and implementation of frameworks
    for vocational education, particularly the National Diploma (NATED) and
    National Certificate (NCV) qualifications within South African colleges.
    The research would focus on how these systems can be effectively
    combined to address challenges in vocational education, experimental
    facilities, policy irregularities, and workplace-based learning.
    Introduction to the Framework for Vocational Education
    Overview of NATED and NCV
    oThe National Diploma (NATED) and National Certificate (NCV) are the two
    key qualifications within South African vocational education, designed
    to enhance the employability of students.
    oThe NATED qualification offers a more academic-based approach, while
    the NCV focuses on practical skills training aligned with specific
    trades.
    Objective of Combining NATED and NCVoObjective: Explore how combining the NATED (academic) and NCV
    (practical) systems can provide a more comprehensive, holistic
    vocational education model.
    oGoal: Enhance industry readiness and workplace skills by addressing
    policy inconsistencies, improving management systems, and ensuring
    strong work-based learning components
    . Experimental Framework and Integration
    Experimental Approach:
    oIntroduce experimental frameworks to ensure both theoretical knowledge
    and practical skills are addressed.
    oImplement real-world case studies, hands-on training, and industry
    feedback mechanisms to ensure the combination of theoretical and
    practical education is balanced.
    Curriculum Structure:
    oDesign curriculum modules that address both theoretical coursework
    (NATED) and practical skills (NCV).
    oProvide a blended learning approach that mixes online learning,
    classroom lectures, and workplace training.

    Program based upon the review of their submitted Project Pitch,potential proposers to the program
    must also qualify as a small business concern to participate in the program (see SBIR/STTR
    Eligibility Guidefor more information).
    The firm must be in compliance with the SBIR/STTR Policy Directive(s) and the Code of Federal
    Regulations (13 CFR 121).• Your company must be a small business (fewer than 500 employees) located in the United
    States. Please note that the size limit of 500 employees includes affiliates.

    Thank you for submitting your company's Project Pitch to America's Seed Fund powered by the National Science Foundation - the NSF’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program. One of our program directors will review your submission and send you feedback via email within approximately one month.


    For you reference, your Project Pitch submission number is 00098889 and was submitted to the Energy Technologies (EN) SBIR/STTR topic area. Please be aware that your Project Pitch may be re-assigned and reviewed under a different topic area if determined to be better aligned with that topic.


    Please make sure to check your inbox and spam folder frequently. You may also view and revise your submitted Project Pitch at https://nsfiip.force.com/mywork/s/my-pitch-submissions Please note that this link will only be available until your Project Pitch enters the review process.


    Please visit our program website for more information about the Project Pitch process, review criteria, current SBIR/STTR Phase I solicitations, and upcoming informational webinars.


    Please also note:


        If the proposed project is determined to be a good fit for the program’s objectives of supporting innovative technologies that show promise of commercial and/or societal impact and involve a level of technical risk, the small business representative who submitted the Project Pitch will receive an invitation via email from the cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Director or staff member responsible for reviewing your Project Pitch to submit a full proposal.
        If the proposed project is determined to be not responsive to the SBIR/STTR Program solicitation (please refer to the “Objectives Not Responsive to the Solicitation” section of the SBIR/STTR solicitation document), the potential proposer will receive a notice stating that the small business is not invited to submit a proposal.
        Project Pitches that are not invited for a full proposal may be resubmitted (with revisions to address any deficiencies) in the next submission window.
        Any small business with a pending Project Pitch must wait for a response before submitting another Project Pitch.
        Any small business that has received an invitation to submit a full proposal must wait for a resolution of the full proposal before submitting a new (or revised) Project Pitch.
        A given small business is permitted to submit one Project Pitch per submission window (please refer to submission window dates listed at the beginning of the solicitation document). Having an invitation to submit a full proposal, or a full proposal under review, prohibits the submission of a new Project Pitch by a given small business, even in a subsequent submission window.

    Should you not receive a response from NSF within approximately one month, please contact us at sbir@nsf.gov. Please include your Project Pitch submission number in the subject line of any correspondence.
    Survey Overview
    The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal submission process recently changed.  We would like to hear from you about this pilot process, which was created to reduce the burden on small businesses and NSF program staff. 
     
    The newly added Project Pitch requires a small business to outline the technical innovation, commercialization potential, and broader impact of their project before submitting a full proposal to NSF.  Only projects that are determined to be a good fit for the program’s objectives of supporting innovative technologies that show promise of commercial and/or societal impact and involve a level of technical risk (mentioned above and outlined on our website: https://seedfund.nsf.gov/) will be invited to submit a full proposal, therefore reducing the time and effort spent by small businesses in order to receive initial feedback on their potential fit with the program requirements.  To gauge the effectiveness and clarity of this new process, we would appreciate your feedback.

    Please note:

    1.      Your participation is voluntary.
    2.      Your individual responses will remain confidential and will be compiled with those from other respondents to improve the NSF’s program.
    3.      Your answers will NOT affect the outcome of any current, pending, or future NSF funding requests.
