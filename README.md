    NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I Eligibility Information:
    In addition to receiving an invitation to submit a full proposal from the NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I
    Program based upon the review of their submitted Project Pitch,potential proposers to the program
    must also qualify as a small business concern to participate in the program (see SBIR/STTR
    Eligibility Guidefor more information).
    The firm must be in compliance with the SBIR/STTR Policy Directive(s) and the Code of Federal
    Regulations (13 CFR 121).
    • Your company must be a small business (fewer than 500 employees) located in the United
    States. Please note that the size limit of 500 employees includes affiliates.
    • At least 50% of your company’s equity must be owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents,
    and all funded work needs to take place in the United States (including work done by consultants
    and contractors).• Primary employment is defined as at least 51 percent employed by the small business. NSF
    normally considers a full-time work week to be 40 hours and considers employment elsewhere
    of greater than 19.6 hours per week to be in conflict with this requirement.
    • The Principal Investigator needs to commit to at least one month (173 hours) of effort to the
    funded project, per six months of project duration.
    For more detailed information, please refer to the SBIR/STTR Eligibility Guide by using
    https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/elig_size_compliance_guide.pdf. Please note that these
    requirements need to be satisfied at the time an SBIR/STTR award is made, and not necessarily
    when the proposal is submitted.

    : Framework for Vocational Education with a Focus on NATED and NCV
    Integration in South African Colleges
    This topic can explore the integration and implementation of frameworks
    for vocational education, particularly the National Diploma (NATED) and
    National Certificate (NCV) qualifications within South African colleges.
    The research would focus on how these systems can be effectively
    combined to address challenges in vocational education, experimental
    facilities, policy irregularities, and workplace-based learning.
    Introduction to the Framework for Vocational Education
    Overview of NATED and NCV
    oThe National Diploma (NATED) and National Certificate (NCV) are the two
    key qualifications within South African vocational education, designed
    to enhance the employability of students.
    oThe NATED qualification offers a more academic-based approach, while
    the NCV focuses on practical skills training aligned with specific
    trades.
    Objective of Combining NATED and NCVoObjective: Explore how combining the NATED (academic) and NCV
    (practical) systems can provide a more comprehensive, holistic
    vocational education model.
    oGoal: Enhance industry readiness and workplace skills by addressing
    policy inconsistencies, improving management systems, and ensuring
    strong work-based learning components
    . Experimental Framework and Integration
    Experimental Approach:
    oIntroduce experimental frameworks to ensure both theoretical knowledge
    and practical skills are addressed.
    oImplement real-world case studies, hands-on training, and industry
    feedback mechanisms to ensure the combination of theoretical and
    practical education is balanced.
    Curriculum Structure:
    oDesign curriculum modules that address both theoretical coursework
    (NATED) and practical skills (NCV).
    oProvide a blended learning approach that mixes online learning,
    classroom lectures, and workplace training.

    For you reference, your Project Pitch submission number is 00098889 and was submitted to the Energy Technologies (EN) SBIR/STTR topic area. Please be aware that your Project Pitch may be re-assigned and reviewed under a different topic area if determined to be better aligned with that topic.


    Please make sure to check your inbox and spam folder frequently. You may also view and revise your submitted Project Pitch at https://nsfiip.force.com/mywork/s/my-pitch-submissions Please note that this link will only be available until your Project Pitch enters the review process.


    Please visit our program website for more information about the Project Pitch process, review criteria, current SBIR/STTR Phase I solicitations, and upcoming informational webinars.


    Please also note:


        If the proposed project is determined to be a good fit for the program’s objectives of supporting innovative technologies that show promise of commercial and/or societal impact and involve a level of technical risk, the small business representative who submitted the Project Pitch will receive an invitation via email from the cognizant NSF SBIR/STTR Program Director or staff member responsible for reviewing your Project Pitch to submit a full proposal.
        If the proposed project is determined to be not responsive to the SBIR/STTR Program solicitation (please refer to the “Objectives Not Responsive to the Solicitation” section of the SBIR/STTR solicitation document), the potential proposer will receive a notice stating that the small business is not invited to submit a proposal.
        Project Pitches that are not invited for a full proposal may be resubmitted (with revisions to address any deficiencies) in the next submission window.
        Any small business with a pending Project Pitch must wait for a response before submitting another Project Pitch.
        Any small business that has received an invitation to submit a full proposal must wait for a resolution of the full proposal before submitting a new (or revised) Project Pitch.
        A given small business is permitted to submit one Project Pitch per submission window (please refer to submission window dates listed at the beginning of the solicitation document). Having an invitation to submit a full proposal, or a full proposal under review, prohibits the submission of a new Project Pitch by a given small business, even in a subsequent submission window.

    Should you not receive a response from NSF within approximately one month, please contact us at sbir@nsf.gov. Please include your Project Pitch submission number in the subject line of any correspondence.
    Survey Overview
    The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)/Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal submission process recently changed.  We would like to hear from you about this pilot process, which was created to reduce the burden on small businesses and NSF program staff. 
     
    The newly added Project Pitch requires a small business to outline the technical innovation, commercialization potential, and broader impact of their project before submitting a full proposal to NSF.  Only projects that are determined to be a good fit for the program’s objectives of supporting innovative technologies that show promise of commercial and/or societal impact and involve a level of technical risk (mentioned above and outlined on our website: https://seedfund.nsf.gov/) will be invited to submit a full proposal, therefore reducing the time and effort spent by small businesses in order to receive initial feedback on their potential fit with the program requirements.  To gauge the effectiveness and clarity of this new process, we would appreciate your feedback.

    Please note:

    1.      Your participation is voluntary.
    2.      Your individual responses will remain confidential and will be compiled with those from other respondents to improve the NSF’s program.
    3.      Your answers will NOT affect the outcome of any current, pending, or future NSF funding requests.

You may not receive feedback from us on your application directly, but please know that it’s being evaluated, and you’ll hear from us as soon as the review process is complete. If you’re selected for an interview, you’ll be notified by someone on the recruiting team. You can view your application status updates through your Action Center. If you see the job moved to an Archived state, that means the position is either no longer open, you withdrew from consideration, or you were not selected for the role. You may notice that we move your application from one role to another. This may happen a few times and is a normal part of our recruiting process. So, if you see the job you applied to in an Archived state, and a new job listed as Active, please know that this is normal and does not negatively impact your candidacy in any way. How’s your profile? A key part of the review process is evaluating your profile in relation to the job requirements, so please make sure your profile is accurate and extensive – it’s our first step in getting to know you! You can build your profile anyway you’d like – you can import it from LinkedIn, manually update it, or import/attach a resume. The most important thing is that your profile tells your story! We encourage you to check back frequently and continue to look for opportunities that match your interests, as new jobs are being posted regularly.

• HMI systems 
• Power supplies 
• Displays and Touchgenerator unit is larger and more expensive 
than a tacholess version of a motor. 
  
If the motor is operated with a pulsed 
voltage (PWM), however, the speed is 
proportional to the duty cycle. At the same 
time, the motor operates as a generator in 
the off-phase of the PWM voltage so that its 
speed can be measured in this phase. In the 
past, in the analog age, the electronic effort 
for such a control was not insignificant, as 
can be seen from the schematic diagram 
in Figure 5. 
  
A rectangle generator, a voltage-controlled 
pulse width modulator, a sample-and-hold 
circuit to measure the actual speed value, 
and a PI controller were required. In the 
digital world, the principle remains the 
same, but the effort required is consid 
erably reduced thanks to the use of a 
microcontroller. 
By Rainer Schuster (Germany) 
Brush-type DC motors 
are increasingly being 
replaced by their brushless 
(BLDC) and stepper motor 
competitors. However, 
their use still makes some 
sense, as the control effort 
is considerably lower. This 
article shows how to keep 
the speed of a DC motor with 
brushes constant regardless 
of the torque – and without a 
tachometer generator. 
  
In the simplest case, a DC motor is connected 
to a variable voltage supply, as shown in 
Figure 1. The speed is (theoretically) propor 
tional to the supply voltage VM, but only as 
long as the torque is constant. Unfortu 
nately, the equivalent circuit diagram of the 
DC motor looks like Figure 2. The motor 
winding not only has an inductance LM, but 
also an ohmic resistance of the copper wire, 
which is designated by RM. The higher the 
torque, the more voltage drops across RM, 
until finally there is no more voltage across 
the inductance LM and the motor stops 
(Figure 3). 
  
Control with Tachogenerator or 
EMF Measurement 
To compensate for these torque-dependent 
speed fluctuations, the motor was once 
usually coupled to a tachogenerator, which 
in turn supplied a voltage proportional to the 
speed (Figure 4). However, a motor-tacho

Practical Implementation of an 
EMF Control 
As the complete circuit diagram in 
Figure 6 shows, an ATtiny45 microcon 
troller from Microchip with 4 kB of flash 
memory is used for control. The controller 
has only eight pins, but is perfectly suited 
for this application. It can be programmed 
“in system” via SV2 using an ISP program 
ming device. 
  
The microcontroller is supplied with 5 V by 
the voltage regulator IC2, which is why the 
input voltage (and thus the motor voltage) 
must not exceed 24 V. Q1 and Q2 control 
the motor. Q2 is a PMOS transistor of the 
type IRF4905, which can theoretically 
handle a motor current of 74 A, but only if a 
sufficiently dimensioned heat sink is used. 
Figure 7 shows what happens at the motor 
terminals during the different phases of 
the PWM signal: After the ON phase of the 
PWM signal, a demagnetization period 
follows in the OFF phase; then the motor 
generates an EMF voltage that is propor 
tional to the speed. This voltage is fed to 
the ADC2 analog-to-digital converter of 
the microcontroller via the R4/R5 voltage 
divider. R5 should be dimensioned so that 
the voltage at ADC2 does not exceed 5 V.

The setpoint speed, which is set by the RPM 
potentiometer or an external voltage of 
0…5 V at X6, is sent to ADC1 of the micro 
controller. Diode D1 is absolutely neces 
sary because when the control voltage is 
switched off, the inductance of the motor 
discharges, which results in a negative 
voltage spike that D1 limits to about 0.7 V. 
Figure 8 shows a suggested printed circuit 
board layout for the motor control with 
EMF measurement; the required compo 
nents are listed in the Component List. 
  
Software I 
The software for the ATtiny45 was written in 
BASCOM. The controller is operated inter 
nally at 8 MHz. Timer0 is operated as a PWM 
timer in Phase Correct PWM Timer mode.

10kWith a prescaler of N  =  64, the PWM 
frequency is: 
  
At 8 MHz, this results in a frequency of 
245 Hz. The pulse width is set via register 
PWM0A from 0 to 255. 
  
Depending on the motor type, the prescaler 
may need to be set to 256, for example if 
the induction phase is longer than or the 
same length as the switch-off phase. This 
results in a PWM frequency of approxi
mately 60 Hz. 
  
In the main program loop, the speed 
setpoint is constantly read in at ADC1. The 
actual value is read in at ADC2 during the 
off-phase (Pwm_Pin=0) and summed up. 
When the motor is switched on again, the 
average of the actual value is calculated. 
  
To implement the PI controller, there is 
the constant Ti (integration time), together 
with the time constant of Timer1 and Kp 
(proportional gain), which must be adapted 
to the motor used. The interrupt time of 
Timer1 is set using the TCCR1 register: 
TCCR1 
Timer1 Interrupt 
4 
250 µs 
5 
500 µs 
6 
1 ms 
7 
2 ms 
When Ti has expired (Timer1-Interrupt × Ti ), 
the speed deviation is calculated, added to the 
previous value (taking into account the sign) 
and multiplied by Kp. The result is output 
directly as the new switch-on duration. 
  
Control Using RI Compensation 
Another practical solution can be what is 
known as RI compensation. As mentioned 
at the beginning, the speed fluctuation of a 
DC motor is due to the ohmic resistance of 
its copper winding. If the current through 
the motor is measured, this resistance can 
be compensated. To do this, only the coil 
resistance of the motor needs to be known, 
which can be easily measured. 
  
The circuit in Figure 9 is similar to that in 
Figure 6, except that the motor current is 
measured as a voltage drop across R5. R5 
is to be dimensioned so that a maximum 
of 0.5 V is dropped across R5 at maximum 
motor current. The power dissipation in 
watts must be equal to R5 × motor current 
squared. Figure 10 shows a suggested 
layout for the motor control with RI 
compensation.

Software II 
The software for the RI compensation is 
also written in BASCOM. Timer0 is config 
ured as a PWM timer with a frequency of 
245 Hz. In contrast to the EMF control, 
the control here is designed as a pure P 
controller. To do this, the coil resistance 
of the motor and the supply voltage must 
be known and specified as constants RM 
and U0 in the program. 
  
The motor current is now measured during 
the switch-on phase of the PWM signal. 
The effective value of the current is calcu 
lated from the switch-on duration: 
  
The duty cycle is then increased by the 
corresponding value. 
  
Two Options 
There are several ways to control a DC 
motor without a tachogenerator. Each of 
these options has different advantages and 
disadvantages:

The MCU obviously requires a separate power supply that 
is independent of the EN input; due to the low-energy 
requirement, a linear regulator is the most economical 
solution here. In general, the concept is completely 
component-agnostic; the author likes to use modern 
PIC16F derivatives from Microchip. 
Figure 2 shows the sub-circuit that informs the PIC when 
the SBC (OPI = Orange Pi) is supplied by the external 
switching regulator (EXT). D1a, R9 and D7a implement 
a more or less “classic” attenuator, which breaks down 
input voltages in the range of up to 20 V to a value that 
is “manageable” for the inputs of process computer and 
microcontroller. 
Splitting the series resistor into the values R7 and R9 is 
necessary because single board computers sometimes 
become a low-impedance load or have a residual voltage 
when they are switched o" — without the resistor, this 
Single-board computers with Unix capability facilitate the 
development of complex control systems. Especially in 
scenarios with high demands on GUI and data process 
ing, they are superior to microcontrollers (MCUs). Unfortu 
nately, power consumption and real-time capability leave 
some room for improvement. But why not combine the 
best of both worlds? If you want to trim an o" -the-shelf 
single-board computer to be economical, you can achieve 
this with an eight-bitter as a partner. As an example, we 
want to implement a system that adheres to programmed 
downtimes and carries out an “alarm start” in response 
to a specific external event. 
The Circuit Concept 
In principle, the circuit works as shown in the flowchart 
(Figure 1). The voltage regulator acting as the main supply 
for the process computer (usually a switching regulator) is 
controlled by the microcontroller via its Enable input (EN). 
By Tam Hanna (Hungary) 
Raspberry Pis and other SBCs are ideal for 
sophisticated process control, but require 
signi! cantly more power than microcontrollers. Why 
not combine the best of both worlds? Here we show 
you how to get an 8-bit PIC to switch on a Raspberry Pi 
whenever it is needed.

100kwould cause the power management microcontroller 
(connected via the PIC terminal) to see strange or invalid 
values. 
R7 is an additional protective element — the inputs of the 
process computer are connected to the supply voltage 
and ground via protective diodes. When very high voltage 
levels occur, R7 ensures that the current flowing into 
these diodes is limited and the process computer is 
not damaged — C13 and R8 provide a small additional 
debouncing function. 
It should be noted that the circuit shown here with its EXT 
input was connected “directly” to the vehicle electrical 
system in various school buses. As there are now several 
thousands of such systems on the market without failures, 
it has been proven to work. 
The role of diode D1a as reverse polarity protection is also 
helpful — please believe the author, who also works in 
the logistics sector, that connecting batteries the wrong 
way round is one of the classic “sports” of a mechanic. 
The Software Is the Key 
Communication via I2C is generally unproblematic (but 
don’t forget the necessary pull-ups). The “secret” of this 
system lies in the software. The PIC implements a kind 
of state machine that is based on the states shown in 
Figure 3. 
The implementation of the shutdown process is of partic 
ular importance. Unixoid operating systems tend not to 
react very kindly to rough shutdowns. A convenient and 
practical way to solve the problem is to implement a 
countdown timer: The SBC activates this countdown 
and then starts the shutdown of the operating system. 
After the (generously dimensioned) period of time has 
elapsed, the process computer is “inertialized” and can 
be disconnected from the power supply. 
Of course, the PIC can also perform other tasks. In 
addition to storing serial numbers and other informa 
tion (in order to make it harder to manipulate), it is also 
possible, for example, to perform basic control tasks on 
the PIC. Of course, more complex implementations are 
also possible: A complex MSR task, for example, would 
make a 32-bit MCU appear reasonable as the second 
ary controller. 
Practical Experience 
Trackers based on the circuit concept shown here are 
now being used in tens of thousands by one of the 
author’s customers, demonstrating the practical value 
of the design. Instead of a stand-by power consumption 
of around 200 mA, the system now gets by with just 
a few milliamperes. The author’s AN4121, published by 
Microchip, is available at [1] and provides further infor 
mation on the topic.

traditional larger installations. With a "xed 
connection to a separate group in the distri 
bution cabinet, the necessary inspections 
and bureaucracy, the costs rise considerably, 
and your pro" ts melt like snow in the sun. 
However, there is light at the end of the 
tunnel and from May 2025, plug-in solar 
panels would — "nally — be allowed in 
Belgium after all. The question, of course, 
is how strict the conditions and modalities 
will be. With a bit of bad luck, you will have 
to be able to present an inspection report 
of your electrical installation, and you run 
the risk of having a “smart” meter shoved 
down your throat. 
Belgians are rather risk-avoiding, and this 
is also re# ected at the policy and regula 
tory level. In my opinion, it would be better 
to ban extension cords with a power strip, 
electric bikes, electric scooters and hover 
boards. These have been in the news several 
times in the context of house "res and with 
the last two devices, you can have serious 
accidents too. I was reminded of this 
after last summer’s commotion around 
a well-known Belgian DIY store that had 
o$ ered plug-in solar panels with the best 
of intentions but had to remove them from 
its shelves again, to its shame.

already been introduced and abolished 
twice, and because of twists and turns in 
the law, users of electric company cars who 
charge them at home will soon be allowed 
to pay a lot more taxes. Belgium does not 
have a monopoly on absurdities, and in 
the Netherlands I hear rumours about grid

And the regulation on the roll-back counter,

THE SERIES 
Rectifiers — those are like diodes, right? Well, yes. But these are not 
the kind of diodes you’d use in your crystal radio. Or even for your 
Raspberry Pi power supply. Or even for that super-duper 200 W per 
channel amplifier you’ve been building. Think electric trains, subway 
systems, broadcast transmitters. BIG stu" . As Crocodile Dundee might 
say, ”That’s not a rectifier, THIS is a rectifier!” 
Liquid Mercury 
Mercury-Arc rectifiers make use of the fact that if a pool of liquid 
mercury with some mercury vapor is used as a cathode, an arc can 
be drawn from a carbon anode above it, but the process does not 
work the other way around. 
Hence, rectification. This is su" iciently electronic to justify their inclu 
sion in this column, even though they’re not the kind of component 
that’s ever been used in an Elektor project. 
Mercury-arc rectifiers were invented in 1902 by Peter Cooper Hewitt, 
an American electrical engineer who had invented mercury vapor 
lamps (the forerunners of our fluorescent lamps) in 1901. They were 
developed in the early 1900s and rapidly became the go-to solution 
for high-voltage, high current rectification. The arc voltage is around 
20…30 V, and the simplicity of their construction makes them e" icient 
and reliable. They were used up to the 1970s, when semiconductor 
rectifiers and thyristors that were up to the same job became available. 
Some were used until 2012. A typical 6-phase rectifier operating is 
shown in Figure 1. 
Mercury Recti! ers 
By David Ashton (Australia) 
Before the advent of high-power 
semiconductor-based recti! ers, 
transforming alternating current to 
DC in industrial and transportation 
! elds was no mean task! The devices 
were huge, fragile, contained highly 
polluting materials, and required 
frequent maintenance.

Ignitor Electrode 
Ignition has to be started by an ignitor electrode, which usually has to 
briefly come into contact with the mercury. This is done by a number 
of means, including electromagnets, bimetallic strips, etc. Once the 
arc has been struck to cause mercury vapor to form, rectification can 
take place. 
Most mercury-arc rectifiers were 3 or 6-phase, but single-phase recti 
fiers needed an excitation electrode to keep the process going. The 
whole assembly is built within a large glass bulb, which allows the

mercury vapor to condense and flow back to the cathode pool. The 
construction of a typical rectifier is shown in Figure 2. 
A typical 6-phase, 150 A rectifier was around 600 mm tall and about 
300 mm round. Above 500 A steel tanks were used with ceramic insula 
tors for the electrodes, and these were rated up to several thousand 
amps. Ratings up to several kV were available, higher with special 
construction techniques, but these required frequent maintenance. 
The mercury arcs emit a lot of ultraviolet light, you could get sunburned 
while working around them. Additionally, the noise from them and the 
associated transformers was considerable. Mercury is highly toxic and 
extensive clean-up work is often needed to remove traces of mercury 
when decommissioning them.

The global solar energy market is on a positive growth trajectory 
as the solar energy industry is in a constant state of evolution. By 
2030, installed renewable electricity generation capacity under 
the IRENA 1.5°C Scenario (see textbox on next page) is expected 
to more than double, with solar PV contributing 49% of the total 
capacity compared to 40% in 2023 [1]. This translates to an 
increase from 4,085 GW in 2023 to 11,173 GW by 2030, driven by 
annual additions averaging 558 GW per year. 
Challenges and Opportunities 
Achieving the 2030 targets will require robust innovation and 
investment. The solar sector’s ability to sustain its current 
momentum hinges on continued advancements in technologies 
like bifacial panels, floating solar farms, and AI-optimized 
energy systems. These innovations will enhance e! iciency and 
integration, ensuring solar’s key role in a clean energy future.

Green hydrogen production, conversion, and end uses. [3] 
Another critical enabler has emerged for 
sectors that are challenging to electrify, 
such as heavy industry and long-haul 
transport, and that one is hydrogen. 
According to IRENA, hydrogen could 
fulfill 12% of global energy demand under 
the 1.5°C Scenario [3], with applications 
spanning transport, power generation, and 
heating. 
However, its production methods vary 
widely in environmental impact, earning 
the labels grey, blue, and green depending 
on the CO2 emissions involved. Currently, 
96% of global hydrogen production 
relies on fossil fuels (grey hydrogen), 
underscoring the need for a rapid 
transition to cleaner methods [4]. The high 
costs of production for green hydrogen, 
and substantial energy losses during 
production, storage, and conversion 
make it less e! icient than alternatives like 
batteries, while increasing blue hydrogen 
depends on costly carbon capture 
technologies. 
Hydrogen: Main Ingredient for Decarbonization 
12% 
of global energy demand 
could be fulfilled by hydrogen 
under the 1.5°C Scenario. 
96% 
of current share of hydrogen 
is produced from fossil fuels 
(grey hydrogen). 
What Is IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario? 
IRENA stands for the International Renewable Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organization that promotes the adoption 
and sustainable use of renewable energy worldwide. The IRENA 1.5°C Scenario in the World Energy Transitions Outlook 
presents a pathway to achieve the 1.5°C climate target by 2050 [2]. Achieving this target requires substantial investments 
in clean energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and storage, to decarbonize global energy systems.

January & February 2025 17This design addresses the need to monitor service interruptions, 
whether caused by technical issues — such as infrastructure mainte 
nance — or by malicious intruders tampering with the external meter 
switch to disconnect the power supply. Such an action could deplete 
the alarm system’s backup batteries, leaving the home vulnerable. 
Triggering an alarm as soon as a disconnection is detected enhances 
overall home security. 
To prevent unnecessary activations, a delay (or tolerance) time of a 
few seconds has been implemented. This helps avoid false alarms 
caused by brief interruptions. In addition to the basic version (see 
Table 1), the digital version o" ers enhanced features: it tracks mains 
voltage drop events, allows adjustment of alarm and delay times, and 
automatically deactivates the signal once the preset alarm duration has 
elapsed. Furthermore, by configuring two DIP switches on the PCB, 
you can enable a beep function and a power-restoration notification. 
These additional features will be discussed in detail later. 
Di! erences Between the Analog and Digital 
Versions 
Analog Version 
As can be seen from the diagram in Figure 1, the power supply section 
has no transformer, which we will find in the digital version instead. 
Therefore, greater care must be taken during testing, since the 
whole circuit is connected to the mains voltage, with danger of 
electrocution in case of contact! In the case of the digital version, 
this danger is limited to the small part of the circuit connected to the 
primary of the transformer, which nevertheless requires a high level 
of attention during the testing phases! 
After the AC rectification and 24 V DC limiting section, consisting of 
diodes D1…D4 diodes and Zener diode D5, we note the split of that 
voltage source into two leads. One heads to the D6-C2 series, the other 
goes to the base of Q1. The D6-C2 series network produces a stabilized

In areas where mains power is unstable

part of the siren or other controlled device of choice. 
In addition to permanent signaling, the Pulse Mode of about 2 s can 
be selected through the other position of switch SW1 (closed contacts 
5-2 and 4-3). In the absence of mains voltage, C3 gradually discharges, 
reducing the voltage across the base of Q1 until it is brought into 
conduction. Q1 thus lets current flow from C2 to the relay, passing 
through C4. The relay is energized, activating the alarm. 
After about half a second, C4 is fully charged, reducing the current 
flow on the relay coil until the relay is de-energized, approximately 2 s 
later. The values of the capacitors and resistors are already calculated 
to make sure that the charge of C2 can sustain the whole cycle. When 
the power returns, Q1 will go o" again, the relay will not change its 
state, and C2 will be charged once more and will be able to support 
new cycles. 
Note the important function of diode D6 in this mode, which acts as 
a “check valve” preventing the base of Q1 from remaining high due to 
the accumulated charge in C2, and the relay from staying o" . 
Digital Version 
The digital version’s greater complexity is immediately apparent from 
the schematic in Figure 2. The circuit is supplied through a trans 
former with a 6 V output, which feeds two rectifier bridges, BR1 and 
BR2. The latter, followed by the stabilization section — consisting 
of C3, a small, 5 V linear voltage regulator U1 and C4 at the output 
— provides power for microcontroller U2, a versatile PIC16F1827 by 
Microchip. In the event of no mains voltage, 1.5 F supercapacitor C5 
will continue to provide enough power to the PIC for a considerable 
time. Management of the supercapacitor is achieved by blocking 
diodes D2, D3 and D4, which isolate it during ordinary operation but 
ensure its charge. 
23.3 V output, used to activate the relay via path 4-6 (steady mode) of 
the DPDT switch SW1. When the mains voltage fails, the relay returns 
to the o" position, thus closing the COM-NC contact. Please note: In 
the circuit diagram, the relay is drawn in its de-energized state, which 
means the alarm is on. This is valid only when SW1 is in Steady Mode, 
in the position represented on the schematic. In the other position of 
the switch (4-3/5-2/Pulse Mode) the relay gets energized just for 1 to 
2 seconds (which means then the alarm is on). 
When the mains voltage fails in Steady Mode, the alarm is activated 
with about a 3-to-4-second delay, due to the energy stored by the 
large electrolytic capacitor C2 being discharged. When power comes 
back on, the deactivation of the alarm will occur with about a 2 s delay, 
the time it takes C2 to charge and provide a high enough voltage to 
activate the relay again. 
Capacitor C5, initially discharged, allows the relay to be instanta 
neously activated at full voltage, but once charged, the current to 
keep it activated is supplied through R5, and reduced slightly, yet 
remaining at a level more than enough to hold the relay contacts in 
the closed position. This technique greatly extends the life of the relay, 
which remains slightly underpowered most of the time. 
The relay should be a DPDT type, with a 24 V coil and an internal resis 
tance of 1,600 Ω. Any mains disconnection that lasts less than the delay 
time mentioned earlier will not produce an alarm activation, since C2 
will not have discharged enough to drop the voltage supplied to the 
relay below its Vo" , measured experimentally at around 4 V. This delay 
avoids unnecessary alarms in case short interruptions might occur. 
In this analog version, the delay time is not adjustable. Another down 
side concerns the alarm time: Once C2 is discharged — and still no 
mains voltage is present at the input — the relay goes o" permanently, 
leaving the alarm active indefinitely. Management of a maximum time

18kThe interrupts then wake the microcontroller for program execution 
every second, basically to count the seconds elapsed and decide if it 
is time to act on the relay — comparing the second counter with the 
reading of the two resistive trimmers RV1 and RV2. 
A further reduction in power consumption is made possible by connect 
ing the hot side of the two trimmers not directly to the supply voltage, 
but to digital output pin RA2, which will be set to logic high level only 
during the reading of the two trimmers, taken via analog inputs AN3 
and AN4 (pin 2 and 3 of U1, RA3, and RA4, respectively). 
Mains voltage drop detection is done by the section starting at 
BR1, which has no high capacitance downstream, but is equipped 
with a circuit that generates 5.1 V when mains power is present. 
Note jumper JP1, provided for removing and reprogramming of the PIC 
without it being powered by the supercapacitor. To avoid excessive 
voltage drops, diodes D2 and D4 were chosen to be Schottky types, 
with a direct threshold voltage VDS as little as 0.2 V. This allows C5 to 
be charged up to 4.8 V, and to get 4.6 V for the backup power supply 
to the PIC, which has a minimum operating voltage of only 2.8 V for 
the chosen model. 
When the supercapacitor supplies the circuit, the reduction of the 
microcontroller’s power consumption is achieved by software-enabling 
the “Nanowatt” mode, introduced by Microchip on most of its micro 
controllers. It sends the controller into a low-power state, where only 
the 32,768 Hz oscillator remains on, reactivating the code execution only 
at the interrupts coming from the timer associated with that oscillator.

curs = 0; // Reset the second counter 
} 
The following interrupt() function constitutes the entry-point of 
the PIC’s interrupt service routine, ISR. It is invoked by the interrupt 
generated by Timer1 when the second expires, even in low-power 
mode. An output is provided on the circuit board on test point TP1 
to verify with a frequency meter or oscilloscope the operation of the 
oscillator. 
TP1’s level toggles every second, producing a 0.5 Hz signal. The ground 
for the measurement is available on the respective GND-labeled 
test point. The main purpose of the interrupt procedure is to count 
the elapsed seconds using the 32-bit variable, curs. The interrupt for 
the next cycle is enabled again downstream of the function: 
void interrupt() { 
// Interrupt Service Routine. 
// It is called every second by Timer1 overflow. 
// --------- TMR1 --------- 
// Manage Timer1 overflow (each 1s) 
// to count seconds 
if (PIR1.TMR1IF == 1) { 
CLKOUT ^= 1; // Provide 0.5 Hz to Pin 1 
// for checks 
curs++; // Update the current 
// second counter 
TMR1H = TMR1H_INI; // Reload counter high byte 
TMR1L = TMR1L_INI; // Reload counter low byte 
PIR1.TMR1IF = 0; // Clear TMR1 Interrupt flag 
} 
} 
After hardware setup and initialization of variables, main() function 
handles events according to the logic of a finite-state automaton. 
The current state of the automaton is set in the Mode variable. First, 
pressing on the SW1 button is verified, to reset the event counter and 
for restarting the microcontroller via the reset assembler instruction. 
At the first power-up with a blank microcontroller, and only then, it 
will be necessary to press the SW1 button to set the alarm count in 
EEPROM to zero. At the execution of setup(), following the button 
press, it will also be forced to turn o" the alarm control relay, in case 
(for any reason) it had remained active. 
In the event of an outage, the SENSE-tagged output voltage drops 
quickly, communicating the event to digital input pin RB1 (AN11), which 
interprets a voltage less than 0.8 V as a binary “0”; with the component 
values in this section, this threshold is reached about half a second 
after the mains voltage drop. By mounting optional resistor R3, this 
delay can be further reduced. 
Based on the high or low level of pin RB1, the management software 
activates the alarm, according to the settings of the two potentiome 
ters RV1 and RV2, which allow you to adjust the delay time between 
0…10 s, and the alarm time from 0…2 min. 
As mentioned earlier, second-counting is handled by the PIC’s internal 
low-power oscillator, fitted with the small external 32,768 Hz watch 
crystal, X1. Again, to minimize power consumption, the relay chosen 
is a bistable, 3 V, double-coil DPDT type. The two sets of contacts are 
connected in parallel to increase the current carrying capacity, which, 
however, may not exceed 5 A. 
The two turn-on and turn-o" coils are driven by Q1 and Q2 transistors, 
whose bases head to the PIC’s RA6 and RA7 pins. The microcontroller 
will thus be able to turn the relay on and o" with short positive pulses 
on those pins. This chip is also connected to a dual DIP switch, which 
enables the two optional functions, Beep and Back. 
The former limits the alarm on to about one second, to provide a 
brief but intense warning to those in the house, for example, alert 
ing them to the voltage drop without disturbing the neighborhood. 
The Back function provides two short pulses to indicate the return 
of mains voltage. However, this function is limited by the maximum 
energy delivery time provided by supercapacitor C5, which is about 
a couple of hours. 
Finally, we note button SW1 and LED D5. The latter has the task of 
using short flashes to indicate the drop events that have occurred. 
If, for example, a power failure has occurred twice, D5 will cycle two 
flashes, followed by a pause of about 3 s. 
To reset the count, simply press the Reset button SW1. This switch 
also performs a full restart of the PIC, and a forced disable of the 
relay, which is useful in case of problems. The two LEDs, D7 and D9, 
indicate the output of the short command to enable and disable the 
relay, which, if not followed by the clicking sound of the relay, help to 
identify a failure of this electromechanical component. 
Software 
Let us focus on the main functions, SetAlm(), interrupt(), and 
main(). The SetAlm function shown below provides for the activa 
tion of the alarm device connected to J2 output terminals by direct 
pulses to the bistable relay. The persistence time of the pulse to the 
relay control coils is defined by the constant RlyTim, currently set to 
200 ms. The coils head to pins RA6 and RA7 of the microcontroller, 
which energizes them through Q1 and Q2 transistors. 
January & February 2025 21 
// the MCU is powered just by supercap! 
curs = 0; // Start seconds count 
STSLED = 0; // Force Ststus Led off 
Mode = Mode_TOL; 
// Enter the Tolerance Mode 
} 
break; 
In the Mode_TOL state handled by the following section, one of two 
possible events is awaited: the return of mains voltage before the delay 
time expires, to return again to the Mode_SBY state, or the overrun of 
that time. 
The condition to be met for the latter case is slightly complicated by 
the management of the optional Beep mode activated via the first of 
the two DIP switches. Depending on the state of this switch, either 
the ttol limit time defined first by the RV1 trimmer reading, or the 
MinTol time set by the initial code definitions, corresponding to 2 s, 
will be selected. Exceeding the limit time brings the automaton into 
the Mode_ALM state. 
The continuation of the code is always bound to the Timer1 interrupt, 
since it continues to operate in low-power mode: 
case Mode_TOL: // Waiting ttol time 
// before activating the alarm 
if (POWER == 1) { // Mains is back 
// before the alarm activation 
Mode = Mode_SBY; // Just go 
// back to Standby Mode 
} else { // Check end 
// of Tolerance time 
if ( ((BeepMode==FALSE)&&(curs>=ttol)) 
||((BeepMode==TRUE)&&(curs>=MinTol)) ) { 
SetAlm(); // Start the 
// alarm, 
IncAlm(); // Increment 
// the alarms counter, 
Mode = Mode_ALM; // Enter in 
// the Alarm Mode 
} 
} 
break; 
This part handles the Mode_ALM state. It waits for the mains voltage 
to return, to reset the alarm and return to Standby by permanently 
exiting the low-power mode. Or one waits for the exhalation of the 
maximum alarm time, chosen from the talm value set by the analog 
reading of the RV2 trimmer, or from the MinAlm value preset to 1 s at 
the beginning of the program. It remains in low power in that case, to 
handle the return of the line voltage to the Mode_BACK state: 
case Mode_ALM: // Wait talm seconds before 
Alarm activation events are counted in the AlmCnt variable. Note that 
— in case the return of mains voltage is very late and the capacity 
to support operations provided by supercapacitor C5 is exceeded — 
in order not to lose the alarm count, the value of AlmCnt is saved in 
EEPROM. The setup() function requires it to be read again when the 
microcontroller is restarted: 
void main() { 
setup(); // Initialization 
while(1) { // Forever Loop 
if (Button(&PORTB,4,1,0)){ 
// Reset button pressed 
STSLED = 1; 
Delay_ms(500); 
STSLED = 0; 
AlmCnt = 0; 
EEPROM_Write(CNTADDR, AlmCnt); 
// Raz the Alarms counter in EEPROM 
curms = 0; 
// Raz the elapsed ms for Blink cycle 
BlkSts = 0; // Reset the Blink automaton 
{asm{reset}}; // Reset the MCU 
// (the program will restart) 
} 
In the following excerpt, the voltages on the analog pins connected to 
the slider of the two resistive trimmers are read; they are dedicated to 
adjusting the delay and alarm times. The reading is made possible by 
activating the hot side of the two trimmers via the digital output pin 
RA2, referred to here as DIVPOW. 
Since the microcontroller has a 10-bit A/D converter, the two readings 
will consist of a value between 0 and 1,023, between limits defined by 
configurable parameters that by default limit the delay time to between 
0…10 seconds, and the alarm time to between 0…2 minutes. 
In default state Mode_SBY, managed by the block that follows, the 
automaton waits for the mains voltage drop event, communicated 
by the SENSE line through pin RB1 (AN11) referred to here using the 
POWER definition. If it goes to logic level 0, then second-counting will 
start, setting the PIC to low-power mode. Please keep in mind that 
from then on, power is provided solely by supercapacitor C5. 
The new state is Mode_TOL: 
// Automaton 
switch (Mode) { 
case Mode_SBY: // Nominal Mode. 
// Wait for a Power Down event 
if (POWER == 0) { // The Main power gone down,

January & February 2025 23The 1.5 F supercapacitor is a special component, but nevertheless 
readily available. In this version, the alarm output is provided via a 
three-way terminal, which allows the user to choose NC or NO activa 
tion type, depending on the intended use. This is not possible in the 
analog version, due to circuit limitations. 
The digital version thus o" ers greater versatility and ease of use than 
the analog one, thanks to the ability to configure the alarm output 
according to one’s needs. However, the analog version retains a struc 
tural simplicity that may be advantageous in some specific applica 
tions. The choice between the two versions will therefore depend on 
the user’s needs and the features of the signaling system to which 
the device will be connected.

In Mode_BACK, it waits for the mains voltage to return and signals 
the event by triggering the alarm for two short consecutive pulses if 
provided by the Back DIP switch. Until the grid returns, the PIC is left 
in low-power mode: 
case Mode_BACK: // Waiting for the mains power 
// to come back again 
if (POWER == 1) { // Mains 
// is back: exit to Standby mode 
ResetAlm(); // Force 
// alarm off 
if (BackMode==TRUE) Signal(); 
// Signal "Mains is back" if requested 
Mode = Mode_SBY; 
} 
break; 
After the main automaton, a second four-state automaton was imple 
mented just to manage D5 connected to RA0. 
This LED is intended to show the current count of voltage drop events 
of duration longer than the delay time. The AlmCnt counter is reset 
table by pressing SW1, managed in the first lines of code of the main 
cycle, seen above. The handling of flashes by an automaton is dictated 
by the need to not interrupt the main cycle with simple delays, which 
would block any other actions during their execution. Flashing times 
are defined by the constants CNTBLINK set to 200 ms, and CNTINTERV, 
which defines the pause between two blocks of flashes, set to 3 s 
(Listing 1). 
Printed Circuit Boards 
For both the analog and digital versions, two single-sided, jumperless 
printed circuit boards have been designed. This will undoubtedly facil 
itate their creation using the classic methods of photoengraving, or 
hot transfer. You can download the Gerber files needed for DIY from 
the Elektor Labs page for this article [1]. 
Assembly 
In the analog version shown in the assembly plan, the SW1 switch for 
mode selection is wired to a six-way connector on the printed circuit 
board. You can connect a lever switch to it, or any DPDT switch. The 
digital version of the device, which can be seen in the mounting plan, 
involves socket-mounting the microcontroller, two miniature-type 
trimmers, a two-way dip-switch, and a jumper.

Wind Power: Wise Move or Waste of Time?
The UK Government recently announced the world’s biggest ever expansion in wind energy. So how realistic is this scheme? What are the pitfalls, technical and otherwise, and how viable is it economically? It’s time to look at wind generation in the round.Wind is simply air in motion, with mass and energy. It has been used for centuries, the most obvious example being windmills. In 1850 the American Daniel Halliday developed the ‘multi-bladed’ farm windmill, a relatively simple device that inspired the first attempts to convert wind into a form of energy that could be either stored for future use, or applied elsewhere.
